My name is Lorenzo Reitano, and I am a Public Health Data Analyst at Surrey County Council. I am passionate about using data science to uncover insights and inform decision-making in public health. As a dedicated self-learner, I have acquired a strong background in Python programming, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, constantly building on my skills and knowledge through various online resources and platforms, such as DataCamp.

As a Public Health Data Analyst, I work with complex datasets to analyze trends, discover patterns, and deliver actionable insights to inform public health policies and interventions. My goal is to harness the power of data to improve health outcomes and promote well-being in our communities.

In this GitHub repository, you will find a collection of projects and code snippets that showcase my data science skills and expertise. These projects span various topics, such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning applications. I hope that my work here serves as an inspiration to fellow data science enthusiasts and demonstrates my dedication to continuous learning and growth in this field.

I welcome collaboration on projects, knowledge sharing, and networking with other data science professionals. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring the endless possibilities of data science together!
